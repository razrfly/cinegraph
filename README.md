# üé¨ CineGraph

CineGraph is an AI-powered Elixir/Phoenix project to measure the **cultural relevance of films**.

The system aims to build a reproducible, data-driven **Cultural Relevance Index (CRI)** that scores films based on a combination of canonical sources, public discourse, critical acclaim, cultural penetration (memes, quotes), artistic influence, and awards.

Our goal:
‚úÖ Mimic and backtest against expert-curated lists like *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*  
‚úÖ Gradually improve accuracy by integrating more external sources  
‚úÖ Offer a dynamic, scalable ranking of films by lasting impact ‚Äî beyond just popularity or box office.

## üß≠ How CRI Works

### Scoring Dimensions

We evaluate cultural relevance across five key dimensions:

| Dimension | What We Measure |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Timelessness** | How long and consistently a film remains discussed, watched, and relevant |
| **Cultural Penetration** | How deeply the film embeds into culture (memes, references, quotes) |
| **Artistic Impact** | Innovation and influence on the craft and other creators |
| **Institutional Recognition** | Formal acclaim, preservation efforts, retrospective attention |
| **Public Reception** | Audience reception across time, beyond just critics |

### Data Sources

CineGraph combines signals from eight major categories:

1. **Canonical Authorities** - Expert-curated lists (1001 Movies, Sight & Sound, Criterion)
2. **Critical Consensus** - Aggregated reviews (Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes)
3. **Academic Citations** - Scholarly references (Google Scholar, JSTOR)
4. **Creator Influence** - Director testimonies and homages
5. **Cultural Footprint** - Memes, GIFs, quotes in popular culture
6. **Public Opinion** - IMDb, Letterboxd, Reddit discussions
7. **Awards & Honors** - Oscars, Cannes, preservation status
8. **Influence Networks** - Film-to-film legacy connections

### Backtesting Methodology

To ensure our algorithm captures true cultural relevance:

1. Import the "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die" list as ground truth
2. Collect comprehensive metrics for each film across all data sources
3. Train scoring weights to maximize overlap with expert consensus
4. Evaluate precision (how many top picks match) and recall (coverage of the list)
5. Continuously refine based on new data and emerging cultural patterns

## üí° What Makes CineGraph Unique

Unlike traditional film rating systems that focus on immediate popularity or box office success, CineGraph:

- **Measures lasting impact** rather than momentary success
- **Combines objective data** from multiple sources rather than relying on single metrics
- **Validates against expert consensus** through rigorous backtesting
- **Captures cultural penetration** through memes, quotes, and references
- **Tracks artistic influence** through creator testimonies and film-to-film connections
- **Evolves continuously** as new cultural patterns emerge

The result is a living, data-driven understanding of which films truly matter across generations.
