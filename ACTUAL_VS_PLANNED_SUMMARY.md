# Cinegraph: Actual vs Planned Implementation Summary

## The Reality Check

### Database Usage: 66.7% Tables Have Data
- **16 of 24 tables** are populated
- **8 tables** remain completely empty
- But even "populated" tables often have sparse data

### Empty Tables (The Unfulfilled Dreams)
1. ❌ `cri_scores` - The entire Cultural Relevance Index system
2. ❌ `external_trending` - Trending/popularity tracking
3. ❌ `movie_alternative_titles` - Alternative titles by region
4. ❌ `movie_translations` - Translated overviews
5. ❌ `movie_data_changes` - Change tracking system
6. ❌ `movie_list_items` - Award/list appearances
7. ❌ `movie_user_list_appearances` - TMDB user list tracking
8. ❌ `user_lists` - User-created lists

### The Surprising Good News

Despite only 66.7% table usage, we have **100% data completeness** for what we ARE storing:
- ✅ All 20 movies have keywords (100%)
- ✅ All 20 movies have videos (100%)
- ✅ All 20 movies have credits (100%)
- ✅ All 20 movies have release dates (100%)
- ✅ All 20 movies have production companies (100%)
- ✅ All 20 movies have external ratings (100%)

### What Went Right

1. **Core movie data**: 100% complete
2. **IMDB IDs**: 100% extracted (good job!)
3. **Budget/Revenue**: 100% populated
4. **Images**: 100% stored
5. **External IDs**: 100% stored
6. **Aggregate metrics**: Successfully storing review/list counts

### What Went Wrong

1. **Cultural Authority System**: 
   - Built 4 tables (`cultural_authorities`, `curated_lists`, etc.)
   - Stored 4 test authorities
   - But NO actual award data, NO lists, NO cultural relevance tracking

2. **Wasted API Calls**:
   - Fetching alternative titles for 100% of movies → Storing 0%
   - Fetching translations for 100% of movies → Storing 0%
   - Attempting watch providers → Storing 0%

3. **The Big Miss**: 
   - Collection IDs only 25% linked (even though we fetch the data)
   - No trending/popularity tracking despite having the table
   - No change detection despite having the infrastructure

### TMDB API Usage Score: C-

We're using the "ultra_comprehensive" endpoint efficiently for basic data, but:
- Missing 60% of available endpoints (trending, discover, search, etc.)
- Discarding 15-20% of fetched data
- Not utilizing any of the dynamic/temporal features

### Database Schema Score: D+

- Overly ambitious design for multi-source cultural engine
- Only 25-30% of schema actively used
- But what IS used is well-structured and complete

### Overall Project Status

**Vision**: A sophisticated multi-source cultural relevance engine that tracks awards, critical acclaim, and cultural impact across time

**Reality**: A well-executed TMDB data importer with unused aspirations

**The Gap**: 
- No external sources beyond TMDB
- No award tracking
- No cultural relevance scoring
- No trend analysis
- Just good, solid movie data

## Next Steps Priority

### Quick Wins (1 hour of work):
1. Store alternative titles (table exists, data fetched)
2. Store translations (table exists, data fetched)
3. Link collections properly (only 25% linked)
4. Fix watch provider storage

### Medium Priority (1 day):
1. Implement basic CRI scoring with existing data
2. Add trending movie fetching
3. Start using discover endpoint for better movie selection

### The Big Decision:
**Do we scale back the schema to match reality, or build toward the original vision?**

Current state: A Ferrari chassis with a Toyota engine. It works, but it's not what we designed for.
