# Person Quality Scores (PQS) - Implementation Audit & Next Steps

## üéØ Original Goal vs. Implementation Status

**Original Vision**: Implement "Gravitas Score" - a composite derived metric aggregating multiple data points about filmmakers and actors across Festival Performance, Canonical Recognition, Career Longevity, Peer Recognition, and Cultural Impact.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **MVP Successfully Implemented** - Person Quality Scores now exist as the fifth metric category alongside Ratings, Awards, Cultural, and Financial.

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished (Commit: 2aafd2e)

### Core Infrastructure Implementation
- **‚úÖ Database Schema**: `person_metrics` table with proper indexing and constraints
- **‚úÖ Person Quality Scoring**: Director quality algorithm (film count + avg ratings)
- **‚úÖ Background Processing**: `PersonQualityScoreWorker` for batch calculations
- **‚úÖ Real Results**: Top directors identified (Kurosawa 87.4, Scorsese 86.55, Bergman 86.11)

### Dashboard Integration Complete
- **‚úÖ Fifth Metric Category**: "People" added alongside existing 4 categories
- **‚úÖ Visual Design**: Orange-themed UI with proper role breakdowns
- **‚úÖ Filter Integration**: People category filter in metrics definitions table
- **‚úÖ Weight Profiles**: Updated to support 5-category system (20% default each)
- **‚úÖ Coverage Stats**: Integration with existing metrics infrastructure

### Technical Foundation
- **‚úÖ Extensible Schema**: `metric_type` field supports directors, actors, writers, producers
- **‚úÖ Version Tracking**: Algorithm versioning and component breakdown
- **‚úÖ Caching Strategy**: Weekly refresh with expiration dates
- **‚úÖ Metric Definitions**: Full integration with existing metrics system

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Weight Profile Inconsistency ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: Current weight profiles don't include "people" category and don't sum to 100%
```sql
-- Current profiles sum to only 100% across 4 categories
-- Now we have 5 categories but weights haven't been updated
"Balanced": {"awards": 0.25, "ratings": 0.5, "cultural": 0.25, "financial": 0.0}
-- Should be: {"awards": 0.2, "ratings": 0.4, "cultural": 0.2, "financial": 0.0, "people": 0.2}
```

### 2. Movie Scoring Integration Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: Person quality scores aren't yet integrated into movie discovery/sorting algorithms
- Movies table doesn't factor in director/actor quality
- Scoring service doesn't include people metrics
- Search/filter interfaces don't use person quality

### 3. Coverage Stats Calculation Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: Dashboard shows 0.0% coverage for Directors/Actors because calculation needs updating
```sql
-- Current query doesn't properly count movies with person metrics
-- Needs to count distinct movies that have credits with scored people
```

### 4. Schema Design Questions ‚ùì
**Question**: Is `person_metrics` the right table name?
- Could be confusing - are these metrics ABOUT people or BY people?
- Consider: `person_quality_scores` or `talent_scores` for clarity
- Current name is fine but worth noting for documentation

---

## üéØ Next Steps - Priority Order

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1)
1. **Update Weight Profiles** - Add "people" category to all 5 profiles
   - Award Winner: Should emphasize people quality (directors who win awards)
   - Critics Choice: Should value acclaimed directors
   - Cult Classic: Should factor in auteur directors
   - Balanced: Equal 20% across all 5 categories
   - Crowd Pleaser: Lower people weight, higher ratings

2. **Integrate Movie Scoring** - Add person quality to movie discovery scores
   - Update `ScoringService` to include people metrics
   - Modify movie search/sort to use director/actor quality
   - Add "High-Quality Director" filters to movie search

3. **Fix Coverage Stats** - Update dashboard calculations
   ```sql
   -- Need proper query to count movies with quality-scored talent
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT mc.movie_id) 
   FROM movie_credits mc 
   JOIN person_metrics pm ON mc.person_id = pm.person_id
   WHERE pm.metric_type = 'director_quality'
   ```

### Phase 2: Expand Talent Coverage (Week 2-3)
4. **Actor Quality Scores** - Apply same algorithm to actors
   - Use similar film count + average ratings approach
   - Consider weighting by role importance (lead vs supporting)
   - Update dashboard to show actual actor percentages

5. **Writer/Producer Scores** - Expand to other key roles
   - Writers: Based on screenplay quality and awards
   - Producers: Based on successful film production

6. **Enhanced Algorithms** - Improve scoring beyond MVP
   - Career longevity: Years active, career trajectory
   - Award integration: Use festival nominations/wins when linking improves
   - Collaboration quality: Working with other high-scored people

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4+)
7. **Canonical Recognition** - Factor in critical lists
   - Directors appearing in Sight & Sound polls
   - Criterion Collection inclusion
   - Film school curriculum presence

8. **Cultural Impact Metrics** - Long-term influence
   - Citations in film studies
   - Influence on other directors
   - Critical essay mentions

9. **Machine Learning Optimization** - Dynamic weight adjustment
   - Learn user preferences for people vs other metrics
   - Optimize weights based on user engagement
   - Personalized director/actor importance

## üîß Technical Improvements Needed

### Database Optimizations
- **Indexing**: Add composite indexes for common queries
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX movie_credits_person_department_idx ON movie_credits(person_id, department, job);
  CREATE INDEX person_metrics_type_score_idx ON person_metrics(metric_type, score DESC);
  ```

### Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Fix warning about unreachable error clauses in `PersonQualityScoreWorker`
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for person quality calculations
- **Documentation**: Add inline docs for all person quality functions

### Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize director score calculations for large datasets
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequent person quality lookups
- **Background Jobs**: Add monitoring for person quality score calculation jobs

---

## üé¨ Movie Integration Strategy

### Weight Profile Updates Needed
Each profile should reflect different philosophies about people quality:

**Award Winner** (People: 25%)
```json
{"awards": 0.35, "ratings": 0.15, "cultural": 0.15, "financial": 0.1, "people": 0.25}
```
*Rationale*: Award-winning films often have acclaimed directors/actors

**Critics Choice** (People: 20%)  
```json
{"awards": 0.1, "ratings": 0.45, "cultural": 0.25, "financial": 0.0, "people": 0.2}
```
*Rationale*: Critics value auteur directors and skilled performers

**Cult Classic** (People: 30%)
```json
{"awards": 0.05, "ratings": 0.3, "cultural": 0.35, "financial": 0.0, "people": 0.3}
```
*Rationale*: Cult films often driven by distinctive directorial vision

**Balanced** (People: 20%)
```json
{"awards": 0.2, "ratings": 0.3, "cultural": 0.2, "financial": 0.1, "people": 0.2}
```
*Rationale*: Equal consideration across all quality dimensions

**Crowd Pleaser** (People: 15%)
```json
{"awards": 0.1, "ratings": 0.4, "cultural": 0.25, "financial": 0.1, "people": 0.15}
```
*Rationale*: Popular films less dependent on auteur theory

## üèÅ Conclusion

**Strong Foundation**: We successfully implemented the core Person Quality Score system as envisioned in issue #258. The technical architecture is solid and extensible.

**Critical Gap**: The system exists but isn't yet integrated into movie discovery - it's visible in the dashboard but doesn't influence movie rankings or search.

**Next Priority**: Update weight profiles and integrate person quality into movie scoring so users can actually discover films through acclaimed talent.

**Assessment**: 70% complete - MVP implemented, needs integration and expansion to fulfill original vision of comprehensive talent-based movie discovery.
