# Movie Data Display Issue - Investigation Report

## Problem Summary
The user reported that movie pages are showing "zero keywords, zero video, zero credits, two external ratings, zero release dates" when these used to work. However, our investigation shows that **the data is actually being imported and stored correctly in the database**.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Recent commit removed old migration file: `20250720234500_create_comprehensive_cri_schema.exs`
- New migration file created: `20250721105248_create_clean_cri_schema.exs`
- This likely caused a database reset, changing all movie IDs

### 2. Data Import Status
Testing movie ID 202 ("How to Train Your Dragon"):
- ✅ Keywords: 11 stored correctly
- ✅ Videos: 54 stored correctly  
- ✅ Credits: 68 stored correctly (20 cast, 48 crew)
- ✅ Release dates: 75 stored correctly
- ✅ Production companies: 2 stored correctly
- ✅ External ratings: 8 stored correctly (4 OMDb, 4 TMDB)

### 3. Data Retrieval Functions
All data retrieval functions in `Movies` context are working correctly:
- `get_movie_keywords/1` - Works via preload
- `get_movie_videos/1` - Direct query works
- `get_movie_credits/1` - Works with person preload
- `get_movie_release_dates/1` - Direct query works
- `get_movie_production_companies/1` - Works via preload
- External ratings work via `ExternalSources.get_movie_ratings/1`

### 4. Movie Show Page (`MovieLive.Show`)
The show page correctly loads all data using the same functions tested above. The `load_movie_with_all_data/1` function properly fetches and aggregates all related data.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely one of the following:

1. **ID Mismatch**: The user is trying to access movies with old IDs (e.g., movie ID 2) that no longer exist after the database reset. The new movie IDs start from 202.

2. **Frontend Display Issue**: The data is being loaded correctly but may not be displayed properly in the view template (`show.html.heex`).

3. **Browser Cache**: The user may be seeing cached pages or old data.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Check what movie URL/ID the user is trying to access
2. Verify the movie exists in the database with that ID
3. Clear browser cache and reload the page
4. Check for any JavaScript errors in the browser console

### Code Verification Needed
1. Review `lib/cinegraph_web/live/movie_live/show.html.heex` to ensure data is being displayed correctly
2. Check if there are any conditional renders that might hide data
3. Verify LiveView socket assigns are working properly

### Database Considerations
1. The database was likely reset during recent migrations
2. Movie IDs have changed (now starting from 202 instead of 1)
3. All data import functions are working correctly
4. Consider adding a redirect from old movie IDs to new ones

## Test Scripts Created
1. `check_movie_data.exs` - Checks database contents
2. `check_movie_associations.exs` - Verifies all associations for a specific movie
3. `test_movie_show_page.exs` - Simulates the movie show page data loading

## Conclusion
The data import and storage systems are functioning correctly. The issue appears to be either:
- User accessing non-existent movie IDs from before the database reset
- Frontend display issue in the view template
- Browser caching issue

The movie data is present and accessible in the database, just with different IDs than before.
