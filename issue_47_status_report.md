# Issue #47 Status Report - Import System Audit

## Completed Fixes ‚úÖ

### 1. Error Handling Improvements
- **Fixed Oban.insert_all error handling** in TMDbDiscoveryWorker
- **Added proper error handling** for all import start operations
- **Added input validation** for decade and ID parameters
- **Fixed Oban migration version mismatch**

### 2. Dashboard Optimization
- **Implemented adaptive refresh intervals**:
  - 2 seconds when jobs are active
  - 10 seconds when idle
- **Reduced database query load** by 80% during idle periods

### 3. Code Quality
- **Fixed all compile warnings**
- **Cleaned up project directory** - organized 50+ scripts into proper folders

## Current Status üîç

### What's Working:
1. **Import starts successfully** - Jobs are created and queued
2. **TMDb API integration** - Movies are fetched correctly
3. **Worker error handling** - Errors are caught and logged properly
4. **Dashboard displays accurate stats** - Shows correct counts

### What's Not Working:
1. **Import Progress Counter** - The `movies_imported` counter remains at 0
   - TMDbDetailsWorker has the update logic but it may not be incrementing correctly
   - Import 42 shows "Found: 2980, Imported: 0"

2. **Jobs Execute Too Quickly** - Jobs appear to be processed immediately
   - No jobs show as "available" in queue
   - May be due to Oban configuration or test mode

## Remaining Tasks from Issue #47 üìã

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix Import Progress Updates** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Debug why `movies_imported` counter isn't incrementing
   - Ensure atomic updates are working

2. **Add OMDb ID Validation** 
   - Validate IMDb IDs before queuing OMDb jobs
   - Handle invalid IDs gracefully

3. **Handle Duplicate Movies**
   - Add logic to skip already imported movies
   - Update progress counts appropriately

### System Improvements (Lower Priority):
- Implement better progress tracking with percentage complete
- Add data quality monitoring dashboard
- Optimize batch operations for better performance
- Add comprehensive integration tests

## Investigation Findings üîé

### Oban Job States:
```
completed - omdb_enrichment: 892
completed - tmdb_discovery: 168
completed - tmdb_details: 5640
discarded - tmdb_discovery: 1 (CaseClauseError - now fixed)
```

### Import Progress Records:
- Import 43 (discovery): running - Found: 0, Imported: 0
- Import 42 (backfill): completed - Found: 2980, Imported: 0
- Import 41 (discovery): failed - Found: 340, Imported: 0

## Recommendations üöÄ

1. **Debug Import Counter**: Add logging to track when/why the counter isn't updating
2. **Add Queue Monitoring**: Display pending vs completed jobs more clearly
3. **Implement Retry Logic**: For failed imports and API timeouts
4. **Add Data Validation**: Ensure movie data meets minimum requirements before import

## Next Steps:

1. Debug why `movies_imported` counter stays at 0
2. Add OMDb ID validation
3. Test with a fresh import to verify all fixes
4. Close issue #47 once core functionality is working
