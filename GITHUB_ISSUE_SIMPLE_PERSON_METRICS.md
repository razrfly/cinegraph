# Simple Person Quality Metrics - Objective Measurements Only

## 🎯 The Simple Approach

**Philosophy**: Instead of complex algorithms, use simple, objective, measurable data that we already have in our database. A person's quality is determined by measurable achievements, not subjective assessments.

**Key Insight**: We don't need to distinguish between directors/actors/writers in the algorithm. What matters is: **How many high-quality films has this person been involved with?**

## 📊 Objective Measurements We Can Make Right Now

Based on analysis of our database, here are the **objective, measurable data points** for any person:

### 1. **Canonical List Appearances** ⭐️
How many movies this person worked on that appear in prestigious film lists:
- **1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die**: 1,256 movies in our DB
- **Criterion Collection**: 1,746 movies in our DB  
- **National Film Registry**: 898 movies in our DB
- **Sight & Sound Critics Poll 2022**: 99 movies in our DB

**Example (Martin Scorsese)**: 36 total movies, 15 in 1001 Movies, 19 in Criterion, 6 in NFR, 2 in Sight & Sound

### 2. **High-Quality Film Count** 🎬
How many movies this person worked on that have high ratings:
- Movies with IMDb rating ≥ 7.0
- Movies with IMDb rating ≥ 8.0  
- Movies with TMDb rating ≥ 7.0

**Example (Martin Scorsese)**: 29 out of 33 rated movies have IMDb ≥ 7.0 (88% high quality rate)

### 3. **Film Volume & Consistency** 📈
Basic productivity and career longevity metrics:
- Total movies worked on
- Average rating of movies worked on
- Rating consistency (standard deviation)
- Career span (earliest to latest film)

### 4. **Festival Recognition** 🏆 (Available Now)
We have 706 festival nominations in our database. Person linking not needed - if someone worked on a film that got nominated/won, it counts:
- **Movies nominated for major festivals** (Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Oscars)  
- **Movies that won major festival awards**
- **Number of different festivals** where their movies appeared

**Works Right Now**: Join person → movie_credits → movies → festival_nominations

*Future Enhancement*: Add personal nominations (Best Director, Best Actor) when person linking is improved, but film-level recognition should count immediately.

## 🧮 Simple Scoring Algorithm 

**Formula**: Weighted sum of objective achievements
```
Person Score = 
  (Canonical Movies × 10) +           // 10 points per canonical list appearance
  (High Rated Movies × 3) +           // 3 points per highly rated film  
  (Total Movies × 1) +                // 1 point per film (baseline productivity)
  (Festival Wins × 15) +              // 15 points per festival win (when available)
  (Festival Nominations × 5)          // 5 points per nomination (when available)
```

**Normalization**: Divide by theoretical maximum and scale to 0-100

**Example Calculation (Martin Scorsese)**:
- Canonical: 42 appearances (15+19+6+2) × 10 = 420 points
- High Rated: 29 movies ≥ 7.0 × 3 = 87 points
- Total Films: 36 × 1 = 36 points
- Festival Noms: 11 nominations × 5 = 55 points  
- **Total**: 598 points → Normalized to ~85-95 range

## ✅ What This Approach Solves

### Advantages:
1. **Objective**: Based on measurable data, not subjective algorithms
2. **Role-Agnostic**: Works for directors, actors, writers, producers equally
3. **Simple**: Easy to understand and explain to users
4. **Scalable**: Can calculate for all ~50K people in database
5. **Stable**: Scores don't change unless new data is added
6. **Transparent**: Users can see exactly why someone scored high

### Current Implementation Issues It Fixes:
1. **No need for role-specific algorithms** - same logic for everyone
2. **Uses existing data** - no new data collection needed
3. **Immediately valuable** - can rank all people right now
4. **Easy to expand** - just add more objective measures

## 🛠 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simple Objective Scoring (This Week)
- [ ] Replace current director-specific algorithm with universal person scoring
- [ ] Use canonical list appearances + high ratings + film count + festival recognition
- [ ] Calculate scores for all people with >5 film credits
- [ ] Update dashboard to show "People Quality" instead of "Director Quality"

### Phase 2: Integrate Into Movie Discovery (Next Week)  
- [ ] Update weight profiles to use person quality in movie scoring
- [ ] Add "High-Quality Cast/Crew" filters to movie search
- [ ] Show person quality scores on movie detail pages
- [ ] Use person quality in movie recommendations

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Add personal nominations (Best Director, Best Actor awards) when person linking is improved
- [ ] Career trajectory analysis (early vs late career quality)
- [ ] Genre specialization scoring

## 📋 Technical Changes Needed

### Database/Schema Changes:
- **Keep current `person_metrics` table** - it's well designed
- **Change `metric_type`** from `director_quality` to just `quality_score`
- **Remove role-specific logic** - same algorithm for all people

### Code Changes:
```elixir
# OLD: Role-specific
PersonQualityScore.calculate_director_score(person_id)
PersonQualityScore.calculate_actor_score(person_id)

# NEW: Universal  
PersonQualityScore.calculate_person_score(person_id)
```

### Algorithm Update:
```elixir
def calculate_person_score(person_id) do
  # Get all movies this person worked on (any role)
  movies = get_person_movies(person_id)
  
  # Count objective achievements
  canonical_count = count_canonical_appearances(movies)
  high_rated_count = count_high_rated_movies(movies)
  festival_nominations = count_festival_nominations(person_id)
  festival_wins = count_festival_wins(person_id)
  total_count = length(movies)
  
  # Simple weighted sum
  score = (canonical_count * 10) + (high_rated_count * 3) + (total_count * 1) + 
          (festival_wins * 15) + (festival_nominations * 5)
  
  # Normalize to 0-100 range
  normalize_score(score)
end
```
