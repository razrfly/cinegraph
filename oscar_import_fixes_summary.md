# Oscar Import System - Fixes Applied

## 1. Fixed EnrichMovieWorker Jobs Not Processing

**Issue**: Jobs were being queued to `movie_enrichment` queue but not processing.

**Fix**: Added the missing queues to `config/config.exs`:
- `movie_enrichment: 10` - For enriching movies from Oscar imports
- `oscar_imports: 3` - For parallel Oscar year imports

**Impact**: EnrichMovieWorker jobs will now process properly.

## 2. Added Parallel Processing for Year Imports

**Issue**: `import_oscar_years` was processing years sequentially, making it slow.

**Fix**: 
- Created `OscarImportWorker` to handle individual year imports as jobs
- Updated `import_oscar_years` to queue jobs by default (can disable with `async: false`)
- Each year now imports in parallel with proper error handling

**Benefits**:
- Multiple years import simultaneously
- Failed years can be retried independently
- Non-blocking imports

## 3. Improved Mix Task User Experience

**Issue**: No feedback about job queueing or monitoring.

**Fix**: Updated Mix task to:
- Show when jobs are queued vs sequential processing
- Provide Oban dashboard URL for monitoring
- Include IEx command for checking status

## 4. Added Import Status Monitoring

**New Function**: `Cinegraph.Cultural.get_oscar_import_status()`

**Returns**:
```elixir
%{
  running_jobs: 2,
  queued_jobs: 3,
  completed_jobs: 5,
  failed_jobs: 0
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Import with Parallel Jobs (Default)
```bash
# Queue jobs for years 2020-2024
mix import_oscars --years 2020-2024

# Output:
# âœ… Queued 5 import jobs for years 2020-2024
# Monitor progress at: http://localhost:4001/dev/oban
```

### Import Sequentially (Old Behavior)
```elixir
# In IEx
Cinegraph.Cultural.import_oscar_years(2020..2024, async: false)
```

### Check Import Status
```elixir
# In IEx
Cinegraph.Cultural.get_oscar_import_status()
# => %{running_jobs: 2, queued_jobs: 3, completed_jobs: 0, failed_jobs: 0}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the application** to load the new queue configuration
2. **Test the import** with a small range: `mix import_oscars --years 2023-2024`
3. **Monitor progress** at http://localhost:4001/dev/oban
4. **Check enrichment jobs** are processing in the `movie_enrichment` queue

## Future Improvements

1. Add progress tracking table for detailed status per year
2. Create dashboard UI for Oscar import status
3. Add retry strategies for common failures
4. Implement batch enrichment to reduce API calls
